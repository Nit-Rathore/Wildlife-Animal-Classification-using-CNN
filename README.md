# Wildlife-Animal-Classification-using-CNN
Built a Convolutional Neural Network for binary classificatiob classify between two similar looking classes (dogs and coyotes) along with my teamates Vishal J Lodha and Niveditha Kundapuram. The model was able to achieve an accuracy to 89.5 percent.

# Data
Dataset was taken from trail camera imagery https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/research/projects/florida-wildlife-camera-trap-dataset/

# Paper
Wrote a paper on the findings and accuracy and look to improve the accuracy and extend it to multiclass classification

# Contribute
The source code will be available on Github and contributions/donations are always welcomed.
